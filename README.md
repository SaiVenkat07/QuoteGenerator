# QuoteGenerator

This is a simple quote generator that displays a new quote each time the "New Quote" button is clicked. 

## Features

- Displays a new quote each time the "New Quote" button is clicked.
- The quote and its author are displayed in an aesthetically pleasing format.
- An Instagram button is provided to share the quote.

## How It Works

The application uses JavaScript to fetch quotes from a JSON file and display a random quote when the "New Quote" button is clicked. If the author of the quote is unknown, it is labeled as 'Unknown'.

## Usage

Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start using the quote generator.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the quote generator by modifying the `index.css` file. The project uses the Fira Sans font, which can be changed to any font of your choice.

## Future Improvements

- Add more quotes to the JSON file.
- Provide more sharing options, such as Twitter or Facebook.
